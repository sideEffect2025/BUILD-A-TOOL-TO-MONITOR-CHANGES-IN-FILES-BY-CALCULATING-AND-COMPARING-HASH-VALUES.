# OVERVIEW:
The File Integrity Monitoring Tool is designed to automatically monitor files for changes by calculating and comparing their cryptographic hash values. Hash functions produce unique values for a file's content, so any change in the file will result in a different hash. This tool helps detect any unauthorized or accidental alterations to files, providing real-time alerts when changes occur.

The tool uses hashing algorithms like SHA-256, MD5, or SHA-1 to generate hashes, and it continuously checks the file for changes at predefined intervals. This ensures the integrity and security of files, making it an essential tool for system administrators, security experts, and anyone requiring reliable file monitoring.
